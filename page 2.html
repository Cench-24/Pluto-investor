       <p>I understand HelpDesk to be a first level support team of the IT department 
        that provides technical support to the end users. Issues Such as hardware and 
        software related problems are resolved by the HelpDesk team. 
       </p>
       <p>I understand that the HelpDesk team is responsible for the resolution of all 
        issues that are reported by the end users to the IT department. 
       </p>
       <p>These issues can be reported using the Sysaid, email, calls or face to face.
